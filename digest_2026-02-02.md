**论文摘要**: While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to

**论文摘要**: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are central to applications across quantum information science. Yet, their performance is limited by the effects of disorder and electrodynamic inhomogeneities that are not well understood. By combining DC transport, dark-count measurements, and bias-dependent microwave transmission spectroscopy in the presence of controlled nanoscale disorder introduced through helium-ion irradiation, we distinguish local instability-driven processes from intrins

**论文摘要**: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon

**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:39
**论文摘要**: Prompt agents have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for automated prompt optimization, framing refinement as a sequential decision-making problem over a structured prompt space. While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying o
**核心总结**: 问题：传统Prompt代理依赖监督奖励信号，但实际场景中常不可用；方法：提出UPA，无需监督信号进行结构化搜索与选择；结果：实现有效的自动提示优化。

## 5. [Analytical topological invariants for 2D non-Hermitian phases using Morse theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23272v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.23272v1
**作者**: Cameron Gibson, Evelyn Tang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:38
**论文摘要**: As energy dissipation and gain are ubiquitous in the real world, such phenomena demand the generalization of Hermitian methods such as the analysis of topological properties for non-Hermitian systems. However, as non-Hermitian systems typically contain more degrees of freedom, this poses a challenge for analytical approaches to understand their topology and invariants. In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich struct

## 6. [TEON: Tensorized Orthonormalization Beyond Layer-Wise Muon for Large Language Model Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23261v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.23261v1
**作者**: Ruijie Zhang, Yequan Zhao, Ziyue Liu, Zhengyang Wang, Dongyang Li, Yupeng Su, Sijia Liu, Zheng Zhang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:30
**论文摘要**: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated strong empirical performance in pre-training large language models by performing matrix-level gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization in each layer independently. In this work, we propose TEON, a principled generalization of Muon that extends orthogonalization beyond individual layers by modeling the gradients of a neural network as a structured higher-order tensor. We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a p
**核心总结**: 问题：现有MuOn优化器仅在单层进行梯度正交化，可能限制性能；方法：提出TEON，将梯度建模为高阶张量进行全局正交化；结果：提供更优的收敛保证。

## 7. [Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation for Resolving Software Issues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23257v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.23257v1
**作者**: Chenglin Li, Yisen Xu, Zehao Wang, Shin Hwei Tan, Tse-Hsun, Chen
**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:25
**论文摘要**: Software issue resolution in large repositories is a long-range decision process: choices made during localization shape the space of viable edits, and missteps can compound into incorrect patches. Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes
**核心总结**: 问题：大型代码库中的软件问题修复涉及长期决策，错误选择可能导致修复失败；方法：现有LLM修复流程多采用重置并解决的方式，未利用过往修复经验；结果：导致资源浪费，因相似问题重复处理。

## 1. [Decoupled Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems on Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23280v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.23280v1
**作者**: Thomas Y. L. Lin, Jiachen Yao, Lufang Chiang, Julius Berner, Anima Anandkumar
**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:54
**论文摘要**: We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This dec

**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:52
**论文摘要**: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise dec
**核心总结**: 问题：DLLM解码中存在计算浪费问题；方法：识别注意力机制中token重要性与可解码性相关性；结果：提出优化策略提升解码效率。

**论文摘要**: Laser-driven capacitor-coil targets provide a compact platform for generating strong magnetic fields and are widely used in magnetized high-energy-density plasma experiments. In addition to magnetic-field generation, these targets also produce plasma in the coil region, which can influence the subject physical processes, interact with secondary targets or external plasmas in their applications. However, direct, time-resolved measurements of the plasma density surrounding the coil remain limited.

**论文摘要**: TCBench is a benchmark for evaluating global, short to medium-range (1-5 days) forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) track and intensity. To allow a fair and model-agnostic comparison, TCBench builds on the IBTrACS observational dataset and formulates TC forecasting as predicting the time evolution of an existing tropical system conditioned on its initial position and intensity. TCBench includes state-of-the-art dynamical (TIGGE) and neural weather models (AIFS, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet v2, GenCa

**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:23
**论文摘要**: Large audio-language models increasingly operate on raw speech inputs, enabling more seamless integration across domains such as voice assistants, education, and clinical triage. This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instru

**论文摘要**: In quantum physics, multiparticle systems are described by quantum states acting on tensor products of Hilbert spaces. This product structure leads to the distinction between product states and entangled states; moreover, one can quantify entanglement by considering the distance of a quantum state to the set of product states. The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and beyond, for instance in the computation of the injective tensor norm in multilinear algebra. Here, we

**arXiv ID**: 2601.23239v1
**作者**: Somak Laha, Suqi Liu, Morgane Austern
**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:09
**论文摘要**: Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent
**核心总结**: 问题：GATs在节点回归中对协变量和边的噪声是否具有统计优势缺乏理论证明；方法：基于图误差模型分析GATs与非注意力GNN的性能差异；结果：GATs在同时存在协变量和边扰动时表现更优。

**论文摘要**: Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art generative learning models, namely conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Invertible Neural Netw

**作者**: Aleksandr Zimin, Yury Polyanskiy, Philippe Rigollet
**更新时间**: 2026-01-30 18:06
**论文摘要**: We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals. This perspective enables
**核心总结**: 问题：如何从优化角度解释Transformer结构；方法：将自注意力视为交互能量的梯度步，MLP视为势能梯度更新；结果：标准Transformer可视为复合目标的梯度下降。
