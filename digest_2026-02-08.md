## 1. [Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06037v1
**作者**: Haoyuan Li, Qihang Cao, Tao Tang, Kun Xiang, Zihan Guo, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:59
**论文摘要**: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enabl
**核心总结**: 问题：现有MLLM在空间推理中几何信息融合效果不佳；方法：提出GeoThinker框架，采用主动感知而非被动融合；结果：提升几何与语义对齐，减少冗余信号。

## 2. [Context Forcing: Consistent Autoregressive Video Generation with Long Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06028v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06028v1
**作者**: Shuo Chen, Cong Wei, Sun Sun, Ping Nie, Kai Zhou, Ge Zhang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Wenhu Chen
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:58
**论文摘要**: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global te
**核心总结**: 问题：实时长视频生成中存在学生-教师不匹配问题；方法：使用短上下文教师指导长上下文学生；结果：教师无法提供全局指导导致性能受限。

**论文摘要**: The impact of the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is studied for a model of cosmic inflation which predicts a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) $M$ for a large-field regime. Since lower values of $M$ are compatible with the higher spectral index $n_s$ provided by the ACT+Planck joint analysis, we establish new limits on this parameter while also considering further CMB data from the latest BICEP/Keck Array release for CMB polari

## 4. [Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06025v1
**作者**: Haozhen Zhang, Haodong Yue, Tao Feng, Quanyu Long, Jianzhu Bao, Bowen Jin, Weizhi Zhang, Xiao Li, Jiaxuan You, Chengwei Qin, Wenya Wang
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:57
**论文摘要**: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent mem
**核心总结**: 问题：LLM代理在超出单个上下文窗口时面临内存效率和信息保留的挑战；方法：提出BudgetMem，一种运行时内存管理方法；结果：有效控制性能与成本的权衡，提升内存利用效率。

**作者**: Kevin Lu, Jannik Brinkmann, Stefan Huber, Aaron Mueller, Yonatan Belinkov, David Bau, Chris Wendler
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:54
**论文摘要**: How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features such as charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second

## 6. [Convex unions and completions from simplicial pseudomanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06016v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06016v1
**作者**: Soohyun Park
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:53
**论文摘要**: While intersections of convex sets are convex, their unions have rather complicated behavior. Some natural contexts where they appear include duality arguments involving boundaries of convex sets and valuations, which have an Euler characteristic-like structure. However, there are certain settings where the convexity property itself is important to consider. For example, this includes (preservation of) positivity properties of divisors on toric varieties under blowdowns. In the case of (restrict

## 8. [Excursion decomposition of the XOR-Ising model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06011v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06011v1
**作者**: Tomás Alcalde López, Avelio Sepúlveda
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:51
**论文摘要**: We study the excursion decomposition of the two-dimensional critical XOR-Ising model with either $+$ or free boundary conditions. In the first part, we construct the decomposition directly in the continuum. This construction relies on the identification of the XOR-Ising field with the cosine or sine of a Gaussian free field (GFF) $φ$ multiplied by $α= 1/\sqrt{2}$, and is obtained by an appropriate exploration of two-valued level sets of the GFF. More generally, the same construction applies to t

**论文摘要**: GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) have become a central component of open-source vulnerability disclosure and are widely used by developers and security tools. A distinctive feature of GHSA is that only a fraction of advisories are reviewed by GitHub, while the mechanisms associated with this review process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of GHSA review processes, analyzing over 288,000 advisories spanning 2019--2025. We characterize which adviso

**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:50
**论文摘要**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must

## 1. [Pseudo-Invertible Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06042v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06042v1
**作者**: Yamit Ehrlich, Nimrod Berman, Assaf Shocher
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:59
**论文摘要**: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is n

**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:59
**论文摘要**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue t

**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:59
**论文摘要**: To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this compone

## 4. [Curiosity is Knowledge: Self-Consistent Learning and No-Regret Optimization with Active Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06029v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.06029v1
**作者**: Yingke Li, Anjali Parashar, Enlu Zhou, Chuchu Fan
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:58
**论文摘要**: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish

**论文摘要**: Photonic quantum computing is a strong contender in the race to fault-tolerance. Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention. In this encoding, linear optics, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters, is necessarily not energy-conserving, and is costly to implement. In this work, we present designs of frequency-mode beam splitters based on modulated arrays of coupled resonators. We develop a methodology

**arXiv ID**: 2602.05998v1
**作者**: Jie Deng, Kaichun Yao, Libo Zhang
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:45
**论文摘要**: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by thi

**arXiv ID**: 2602.05997v1
**作者**: Jia Yuan Yu
**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:43
**论文摘要**: We consider a causal inference problem frequently encountered in online advertising systems, where a publisher (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) interacts repeatedly with human users and advertisers by sporadically displaying to each user an advertisement selected through an auction. Each treatment corresponds to a parameter value of the advertising mechanism (e.g., auction reserve-price), and we want to estimate through experiments the corresponding long-term treatment effect (e.g., annual advertising

**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:42
**论文摘要**: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connect

**更新时间**: 2026-02-05 18:42
**论文摘要**: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond
