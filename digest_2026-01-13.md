**论文摘要**: In this work, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with four women to explore how they perceive themselves with respect to three gender constructs (femininity, masculinity, androgyny), and how they believe others perceive them. All the women highlighted the performative nature of gender in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), citing (1) stereotypes that women are not analytical thinkers, or femininity being associated with "being stupid"; (2) the pressure to 
**核心总结**: 问题：探讨女性在STEM领域对自身及他人性别认知的感知；方法：对四名女性进行半结构化访谈；结果：发现女性认为性别在STEM中具有表演性，面临分析能力刻板印象和女性气质与“愚蠢”关联的压力。

**论文摘要**: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic nanofilms is highly sensitive to the microstructural and magnetic homogeneity. However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of

**arXiv ID**: 2601.07113v1
**作者**: Natham Aguirre

**论文摘要**: This work is concerned with the study of $w(mT)$ as $m$ goes to infinity, where $w(t)$ evolves according to $w(t)-w(t-1)=F(t)-A(t)w(t-1)$, and where $T$ is the period of the vector $F(t)$ and the matrix $A(t)$. Motivated by applications to associative learning, particularly to discrimination training, extra conditions are imposed on $F(t)$ and $A(t)$, one of them relating $A(t)$ to a symmetric non-negative definite matrix $K$ relevant to mathematical models of associative learning.

## 5. [The Need for a Socially-Grounded Persona Framework for User Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07110v1)

**论文摘要**: Synthetic personas are widely used to condition large language models (LLMs) for social simulation, yet most personas are still constructed from coarse sociodemographic attributes or summaries. We revisit persona creation by introducing SCOPE, a socially grounded framework for persona construction and evaluation, built from a 141-item, two-hour sociopsychological protocol collected from 124 U.S.-based participants. Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bott

**作者**: Meng Lu, Yuxing Lu, Yuchen Zhuang, Megan Mullins, Yang Xie, Guanghua Xiao, Charles Fleming, Wenqi Shi, Xuan Wang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-12 00:11
**论文摘要**: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on general image understanding but struggle to think with medical images, especially when performing multi-step reasoning through iterative visual interaction. Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastruc

**论文摘要**: We establish a sharp point-sphere incidence bound in finite fields for point sets exhibiting controlled additive structure. Working in the framework of \((4,s)\)-Salem sets, which quantify pseudorandomness via fourth-order additive energy, we prove that if \(P\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d\) is a \((4,s)\)-Salem set with \(s\in \big( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2} \big]\) and \(|P|\ll q^{ \frac{d}{4s}}\), then for any finite family \(S\) of spheres in \(\mathbb{F}_q^d\), \[ \bigg| I(P,S)-\frac{|P||S| }{q} \bi

## 9. [Score-Based VAMP with Fisher-Information-Based Onsager Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07095v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.07095v1
**作者**: Tadashi Wadayama, Takumi Takahashi
**更新时间**: 2026-01-11 23:34
**论文摘要**: We propose score-based VAMP (SC-VAMP), a variant of vector approximate message passing (VAMP) in which the Onsager correction is expressed and computed via conditional Fisher information, thereby enabling a Jacobian-free implementation. Using learned score functions, SC-VAMP constructs nonlinear MMSE estimators through Tweedie's formula and derives the corresponding Onsager terms from the score-norm statistics, avoiding the need for analytical derivatives of the prior or likelihood.

**论文摘要**: Low-dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise that degrades image quality and diagnostic reliability. Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based 
**核心总结**: 问题：低剂量PET成像噪声大，影响图像质量和诊断可靠性；方法：提出Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet（WCC-Net），结合小波变换与ControlNet增强结构一致性；结果：无。

**论文摘要**: Large language models (LLMs) are used not only for problem solving but also for creative ideation; however, eliciting serendipitous insights that are both novel and internally coherent remains difficult. While stochastic sampling promotes novelty, it often degrades consistency. Here, we propose ReMIND, a REM-inspired modular framework for ideation. ReMIND consists of four stages: wake, which generates a stable low-temperature semantic baseline; dream, which performs high-temperature exploratory

**作者**: Valentin Nkana Ngan, Giovanni Stabile, Andrea Mola, Gianluigi Rozza
**更新时间**: 2026-01-11 22:14
**论文摘要**: We propose an efficient hyper-reduced order model (HROM) designed for segregated finite-volume solvers in geometrically parametrized problems. The method follows a discretize-then-project strategy: the full-order operators are first assembled using finite volume or finite element discretizations and then projected onto low-dimensional spaces using a small set of spatial sampling points, selected through hyper-reduction techniques such as DEIM. This approach removes the dependence of the online c

**论文摘要**: Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the cont

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero,
