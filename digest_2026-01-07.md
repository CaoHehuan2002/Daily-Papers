## 1. [Muses: Designing, Composing, Generating Nonexistent Fantasy 3D Creatures without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03256v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.03256v1
**作者**: Hexiao Lu, Xiaokun Sun, Zeyu Cai, Hao Guo, Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Zhenyu Zhang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-06 18:59
**论文摘要**: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse 
**核心总结**: 问题：传统方法生成3D生物角色存在不真实或不连贯的问题；方法：Muses利用3D骨骼结构进行无训练的生成；结果：可合理组合多样生物形态。

**论文摘要**: With the release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog GWTC-4.0 by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, 218 candidate detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) have been reported. This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full popu

**论文摘要**: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variet
**核心总结**: 问题：AIGC模型在实际应用中难以实现端到端任务处理；方法：分析现有模型在复杂场景下的局限性；结果：多数模型仅能作为局部组件，无法适应多样化真实场景需求。

**更新时间**: 2026-01-06 18:29
**论文摘要**: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each mem

**论文摘要**: Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representa

## 6. [Open-Source Coil Matching Toolbox for Magnetic Stimulation and Other Electromagnetics (COMATOSE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03224v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.03224v1
**作者**: Max Koehler, Stefan Goetz
**更新时间**: 2026-01-06 18:12
**论文摘要**: The coil in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) determines the spatial shape of the electromagnetic field in the head, which structures are concurrently activated, and how focal stimulation is. Most of the readily available coils have been designed intuitively instead of systematic mathematical-physical optimization as there were no methods available at the time. Previous research however demonstrated that these coils are far from optimum, e.g., for pulse energy or efficiency, and leave subs

## 7. [Are eHMIs always helpful? Investigating how eHMIs interfere with pedestrian behavior on multi-lane streets: An eye-tracking virtual reality experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03223v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.03223v1
**作者**: Yun Ye, Zexuan Li, Panagiotis Angeloudis, S. C. Wong, Jian Sun, Haoyang Liang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-06 18:08
**论文摘要**: Appropriate communication is crucial for efficient and safe interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs, which can be categorized as allocentric or egocentric, are considered a promising solution. While the effectiveness of eHMIs has been extensively studied, in complex environments, such as unsignalized multi-lane streets, their potential to interfere with pedestrian crossing behavior remains underexplored. Hence, a virtual re

**论文摘要**: Digital network twin is a promising technology that replicates real-world networks in real-time and assists with the design, operation, and management of next-generation networks. However, existing approaches (e.g., simulator-based and neural-based) cannot effectively realize the digital network twin, in terms of fidelity, synchronicity, and tractability. In this paper, we propose oneTwin, the first online digital twin system, for the prediction of physical layer metrics. We architect the oneTwi

**更新时间**: 2026-01-06 17:23
**论文摘要**: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the se

**论文摘要**: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for a

## 2. [STReasoner: Empowering LLMs for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Time Series via Spatial-Aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03248v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.03248v1
**作者**: Juntong Ni, Shiyu Wang, Ming Jin, Qi He, Wei Jin
**更新时间**: 2026-01-06 18:46
**论文摘要**: Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reaso

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters

**论文摘要**: This paper develops our work on the consequences of the Regge calculus, where some edge length scale arises as an optimal starting point of the perturbative expansion with taking into account a bell-shaped form of the measure obtained using functional integration over connection.   A "hypercubic" structure is considered (some variables are frozen), it is described by the metric $g_{λμ}$ at the sites.   The edge length scale as some maximum point of the measure is $\sim η^{1 / 2}$, where $η$ defi
