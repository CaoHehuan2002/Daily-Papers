## 1. [WildRayZer: Self-supervised Large View Synthesis in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10716v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10716v1
**作者**: Xuweiyi Chen, Wentao Zhou, Zezhou Cheng
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:59
**论文摘要**: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we co
**核心总结**: 问题：动态环境中存在相机和物体运动，导致传统NVS模型出现伪影和不稳定；方法：提出WildRayZer框架，通过分析-合成测试分离静态结构与瞬态区域；结果：利用残差揭示动态部分，提升新视角合成质量。

## 2. [DInf-Grid: A Neural Differential Equation Solver with Differentiable Feature Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10715v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10715v1
**作者**: Navami Kairanda, Shanthika Naik, Marc Habermann, Avinash Sharma, Christian Theobalt, Vladislav Golyanik
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:59
**论文摘要**: We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute highe

## 3. [Grounding Agent Memory in Contextual Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10702v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10702v1
**作者**: Ruozhen Yang, Yucheng Jiang, Yueqi Jiang, Priyanka Kargupta, Yunyi Zhang, Jiawei Han
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:55
**论文摘要**: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual 
**核心总结**: 问题：长周期目标导向交互中，记忆系统因实体和事实重复而检索错误；方法：提出STITCH，通过结构化检索线索和上下文意图进行历史检索；结果：无。

## 4. [LIBERTy: A Causal Framework for Benchmarking Concept-Based Explanations of LLMs with Structural Counterfactuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10700v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10700v1
**作者**: Gilat Toker, Nitay Calderon, Ohad Amosy, Roi Reichart
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:54
**论文摘要**: Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets contai
**核心总结**: 问题：如何提高概念解释的可靠性；方法：引入构建数据集的框架以生成更准确的反事实；结果：提升对模型行为影响的量化分析。

## 5. [Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10698v1
**作者**: Cesare Tronci
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:54
**论文摘要**: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum g

## 6. [Quantum geometry of the rotating shallow water model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10695v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10695v1
**作者**: Sriram Ganeshan, Alan T. Dorsey
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:52
**论文摘要**: The rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) are a mainstay of atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and their wave dynamics has close analogues in settings ranging from two-dimensional electron gases to active-matter fluids. While recent work has emphasized the topological character of RSWE wave bands, here we develop a complementary quantum-geometric description by computing the full quantum geometric tensor (QGT) for the linearized RSWE on an $f$-plane. The QGT unifies two pieces of band geometry:

## 7. [An Extension-Based Accessibility Framework for Making Blockly Accessible to Blind and Low-Vision Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10688v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10688v1
**作者**: Rubel Hassan Mollik, Vamsi Krishna Kosuri, Hans Djalali, Stephanie Ludi, Aboubakar Mountapmbeme
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:48
**论文摘要**: Block-based programming environments (BBPEs) such as Scratch and Code.org are now widely used in K-12 computer science classes, but they remain mostly inaccessible to blind or visually impaired (BVI) learners. A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. 
**核心总结**: 问题：BBPEs对BVI学生不具可访问性；方法：提出基于扩展的EAF框架；结果：提升BBPEs对BVI学生的可访问性。

**arXiv ID**: 2601.10686v1
**作者**: Daniel Barake, Owen Chuchman, Cameron Franc, Geoffrey Mason, Brett Nasserden
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:46
**论文摘要**: This paper describes the vector bundle on the elliptic modular curve that is associated to a vertex operator algebra $V$ (VOA) or more generally a quasi-vertex operator algebra (QVOA), with a view towards future applications aimed at studying the characters of VOAs. We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$

**作者**: Maissam Barkeshli, Alberto Alfarano, Andrey Gromov
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:46
**论文摘要**: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with

## 1. [UFO Trees: Practical and Provably-Efficient Parallel Batch-Dynamic Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10706v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10706v1
**作者**: Quinten De Man, Atharva Sharma, Kishen N Gowda, Laxman Dhulipala
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:57
**论文摘要**: The dynamic trees problem is to maintain a tree under edge updates while supporting queries like connectivity queries or path queries. Despite the first data structure for this fundamental problem -- the link-cut tree -- being invented 40 years ago, our experiments reveal that they are still the fastest sequential data structure for the problem. However, link-cut trees cannot support parallel batch-dynamic updates and have limitations on the kinds of queries they support.   In this paper, we des

**arXiv ID**: 2601.10697v1
**作者**: Manuj Mukherjee, Sagnik Chatterjee, Alhad Sethi
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:53
**论文摘要**: Nitinawarat and Narayan proposed a perfect secret key generation scheme for the so-called \emph{pairwise independent network (PIN) model} by exploiting the combinatorial properties of the underlying graph, namely the spanning tree packing rate. This work considers a generalization of the PIN model where the underlying graph is replaced with a hypergraph, and makes progress towards designing similar perfect secret key generation schemes by exploiting the combinatorial properties of the hypergraph
**核心总结**: 问题：在超图替代传统图的广义PIN模型中生成完美密钥；方法：利用超图的组合性质，如生成树打包率；结果：推进了类似完美密钥生成方案的设计。

**论文摘要**: The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-ch

**arXiv ID**: 2601.10691v1
**作者**: Lorena A. Barba, Laura Stegner
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:50
**论文摘要**: Traditional assessment methods collapse when students use generative AI to complete work without genuine engagement, creating an illusion of competence where they believe they're learning but aren't. This paper presents the conversational exam -- a scalable oral examination format that restores assessment validity by having students code live while explaining their reasoning. Drawing on human-computer interaction principles, we examined 58 students in small groups across just two days, demonstra

## 7. [Safe Trajectory Gradient Flow Control of a Grid-Interfacing Inverter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10671v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10671v1
**作者**: Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:36
**论文摘要**: Grid-interfacing inverters serve as the interface between renewable energy resources and the electric power grid, offering fast, programmable control capabilities. However, their operation is constrained by hardware limitations, such as bounds on the current magnitude. Existing control methods for these systems often neglect these constraints during controller design and instead rely on ad hoc limiters, which can introduce instability or degrade performance. In this work, we present a control fr

**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:25
**论文摘要**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collab
**核心总结**: 问题：LLM在进化搜索中存在上下文污染、模式崩溃和协作薄弱等失败模式；方法：提出系统化框架以管理进化过程；结果：提升搜索效率与多样性。

## 9. [RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10644v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10644v1
**作者**: Eugene Yang, Andrew Yates, Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield, Trevor Adriaanse
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:04
**论文摘要**: Retrieval models are key components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which generate search queries, process the documents returned, and generate a response. RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplificatio

## 10. [CoMoVi: Co-Generation of 3D Human Motions and Realistic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10632v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10632v1

**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 17:52
**论文摘要**: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within
**核心总结**: 问题：3D人体动作与2D视频生成耦合；方法：提出CoMoVi框架，同步生成3D动作和视频；结果：无。
