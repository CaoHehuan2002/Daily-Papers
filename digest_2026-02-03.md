## 1. [A global potential constrained by the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for $α$-decay half-lives of even-even nuclei](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02070v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.02070v1
**作者**: Nguyen Gia Huy, Do Huy Tho, Mai Doan Quang Huy, Nguyen Le Anh
**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 13:11
**论文摘要**: The $α$ decay provides valuable constraints on nuclear structure and plays an essential role in identifying heavy and superheavy nuclei. We study $α$-decay half-lives of 178 even-even nuclei within a semi-classical WKB framework using a phenomenological Woods-Saxon $α$-nucleus potential. The potential depth is determined by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition (BSQC), ensuring a physically consistent description of the quasibound $α$-daughter system. To facilitate large-scale calc

**arXiv ID**: 2602.02064v1
**作者**: Yasser Saleem, Moritz Cygorek
**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 13:04
**论文摘要**: We present a fully atomistic approach to exciton-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots that bridges microscopic electronic-structure calculations with non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics. On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method.

**论文摘要**: This paper investigates the \textbf{graphical $r$-Stirling numbers of the first kind}, denoted by $\str{G}{k}$, which enumerate partitions of a vertex set $V(G)$ into $k$ disjoint cycles such that $r$ specified vertices occupy distinct blocks.

**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 12:40
**论文摘要**: The increasing availability of relational data has contributed to a growing reliance on network-based representations of complex systems. Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced properties, such as the heterogeneity of relationships, leading to the concept of multilayer networks. However, the analysis and evaluation of methods for these structures is often hindered by the limited availability of large-scale empirical data. As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a

## 5. [Relative Rota-Baxter operators and crossed homomorphisms on Lie 2-groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02041v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.02041v1
**作者**: Honglei Lang, Shining Wang
**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 12:38
**论文摘要**: A relative Rota-Baxter operator on Lie 2-groups is introduced as a pair of relative Rota-Baxter operators on the underlying Lie groups which is also a Lie groupoid morphism. Such an operator induces a factorization theorem for Lie 2-groups and gives rise to a categorical solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We further define relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie group crossed modules. The well-known one-to-one correspondence between Lie 2-groups and crossed modules is extended to an equivalence

**论文摘要**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to perform complex, multi-step workflows in regulated settings such as compliance and due diligence. However, many agentic architectures rely primarily on prompt engineering of a single agent, making it difficult to observe or compare how models handle uncertainty and coordination across interconnected decision stages and with human oversight. We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MD

**arXiv ID**: 2602.02031v1
**作者**: Martin Determann, Elvira Fleig
**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 12:29
**论文摘要**: Steered Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has recently emerged as a powerful framework for spatial-domain image modeling, enabling high-fidelity image representation using a remarkably small number of parameters. Its ability to steer kernel-based experts toward structural image features has led to successful applications in image compression, denoising, super-resolution, and light field processing. However, practical adoption is hindered by the reliance on gradient-based optimization to estimate model p

## 9. [Do I Really Know? Learning Factual Self-Verification for Hallucination Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02018v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.02018v1

**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 12:15
**论文摘要**: Factual hallucination remains a central challenge for large language models (LLMs). Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior. We propose VeriFY, a training-time framework that teaches LLMs to reason about factual uncertainty through consistency-based self-verification. VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guid

## 1. [Silhouette Score Efficient Radio Frequency Fingerprint Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02065v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.02065v1
**作者**: Xuan Yang, Dongming Li, Yi Lou, Xianglin Fan
**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 13:05
**论文摘要**: Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification technology, which exploits relatively stable hardware imperfections, is highly susceptible to constantly changing channel effects. Although various channel-robust RFF feature extraction methods have been proposed, they predominantly rely on experimental comparisons rather than theoretical analyses. This limitation hinders the progress of channel-robust RFF feature extraction and impedes the establishment of theoretical guidance for its design. In

**论文摘要**: Automated vehicles lack natural communication channels with other road users, making external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) essential for conveying intent and maintaining trust in shared environments. However, most eHMI studies rely on developer-crafted message-action pairs, which are difficult to adapt to diverse and dynamic traffic contexts. A promising alternative is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as action designers that generate context-conditioned eHMI actions, yet such designers l

**论文摘要**: Tool-using agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and multi-hop question answering. However, in long trajectories, agents often trigger excessive and low-quality tool calls, increasing latency and degrading inference performance, making managing tool-use behavior challenging. In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this

**更新时间**: 2026-02-02 12:13
**论文摘要**: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn predictive models that can generalize to unseen domains. Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution

**论文摘要**: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and texture without optimization. Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue,
