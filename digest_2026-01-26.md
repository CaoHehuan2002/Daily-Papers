## 1. [Tunable Edelstein effect in intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16980v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.16980v1
**作者**: Weiyi Pan, Jaroslav Fabian
**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 18:59
**论文摘要**: The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroele
**核心总结**: 问题：金属铁电材料中实现非易失性电荷-自旋转换的Edelstein效应研究不足；方法：分析金属铁电材料的结构特性与Edelstein效应的关联；结果：金属铁电材料中Edelstein效应尚未被广泛报道，需进一步研究。

**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 18:49
**论文摘要**: Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study an

**作者**: Lennart Schäpermeier, Pascal Kerschke
**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 18:42
**论文摘要**: The evaluation of heuristic optimizers on test problems, better known as \emph{benchmarking}, is a cornerstone of research in multi-objective optimization.   However, most test problems used in benchmarking numerical multi-objective black-box optimizers come from one of two flawed approaches: On the one hand, problems are constructed manually, which result in problems with well-understood optimal solutions, but unrealistic properties and biases.   On the other hand, more realistic and complex si

**作者**: Olivia Pal, Veda Duddu, Agam Goyal, Drishti Goel, Koustuv Saha
**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 18:27
**论文摘要**: Trust and reliance are often treated as coupled constructs in human-AI interaction research, with the assumption that calibrating trust will lead to appropriate reliance. We challenge this assumption in educational contexts, where students increasingly turn to AI for learning support. Through semi-structured interviews with graduate students (N=8) comparing AI-generated and human-generated responses, we find a systematic dissociation: students exhibit high trust but low reliance on human experts

**作者**: Roman Poletukhin, Marcel Kollovieh, Eike Eberhard, Stephan Günnemann
**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 18:24
**论文摘要**: Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid moti

**论文摘要**: Time-dependent electronic structure methods provide an efficient, accurate, and robust alternative to traditional time dependent methods for computing both linear and non-linear optical properties. With this in mind, we have developed the real-time Tamm-Dancoff approximation (RT-TDA). This is an approach to model electron dynamics by propagating the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) amplitudes within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and adiabatic approximati

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusio
**核心总结**: 问题：MDMs与ARMs存在性能差距且训练效率低；方法：提出ARMD模型，结合ARMs的训练效率和扩散模型的并行生成能力；结果：有效缩小性能差距。

**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 17:46
**论文摘要**: Extreme heat is an escalating public health concern. Although prior studies have examined heat-health associations, their reliance on restricted diagnoses and diagnostic categories misses or misclassifies heat-related illness. We conducted a heat-wide association study to identify acute-care diagnoses associated with extreme heat in Chicago, Illinois.

**作者**: Javed I. Khan, Sharmila Rahman Prithula
**更新时间**: 2026-01-23 17:44
**论文摘要**: Harm is invoked everywhere from cybersecurity, ethics, risk analysis, to adversarial AI, yet there exists no systematic or agreed upon list of harms, and the concept itself is rarely defined with the precision required for serious analysis. Current discourse relies on vague, under specified notions of harm, rendering nuanced, structured, and qualitative assessment effectively impossible. This paper challenges that gap directly. We introduce a structured and expandable taxonomy of harms, grounded

**论文摘要**: We revisit the classic Maximum $k$-Coverage problem: Determine the largest number $t$ of elements that can be covered by choosing $k$ sets from a given family $\mathcal{F} = \{S_1,\dots, S_n\}$ of a size-$u$ universe. A notable special case is Partial $k$-Dominating Set, where one chooses $k$ vertices in a graph to maximize the number of dominated vertices.   Extensive research has established strong hardness results for various aspects of Maximum $k$-Coverage, such as tight inapproximability re

**论文摘要**: The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced prefe
