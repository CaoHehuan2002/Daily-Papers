## 1. [Weak lensing of bright standard sirens: prospects for $σ_8$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06023v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.06023v1
**作者**: Ville Vaskonen
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:58
**论文摘要**: Gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts provide direct measurements of the Hubble diagram. We demonstrate that incorporating weak lensing into bright standard siren analyses allows measurements of cosmological parameters that do not influence the mean luminosity distance-redshift relation but do impact the cosmic structures. In particular, we examine the prospects for measuring the standard deviation of matter perturbations $σ_8$, in addition to the Hubble constant and the ma

## 2. [Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.06020v1
**作者**: David A. Meyer, Asif Shakeel
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:57
**论文摘要**: We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers per

**论文摘要**: Given a set $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ of real numbers and real coefficients $b_1,\ldots,b_n$, consider the distribution of the sum obtained by pairing the $a_i$'s with the $b_i$'s according to a uniformly random permutation. A recent theorem of Pawlowski shows that as soon as the coefficients are not all equal, this distribution is always spread out at scale $n^{-1}$: no single value can occur with probability larger than $\frac{1}{2\lceil n/2\rceil + 1}$, and this bound is sharp in general.   We s

## 4. [On the Effect of Misspecifying the Embedding Dimension in Low-rank Network Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06014v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.06014v1
**作者**: Roddy Taing, Keith Levin
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:51
**论文摘要**: As network data has become ubiquitous in the sciences, there has been growing interest in network models whose structure is driven by latent node-level variables in a (typically low-dimensional) latent geometric space. These "latent positions" are often estimated via embeddings, whereby the nodes of a network are mapped to points in Euclidean space so that "similar" nodes are mapped to nearby points. Under certain model assumptions, these embeddings are consistent estimates of the latent positio

**作者**: Jiayin Hu, Nikolaos Tziavelis
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:51
**论文摘要**: Direct access asks for the retrieval of query answers by their ranked position, given a query and a desired order. While the time complexity of data structures supporting such accesses has been studied in depth, and efficient algorithms for many queries and common orders are known, their practical performance has received little attention. We provide an implementation covering a wide range of queries and orders; it allows us to investigate intriguing practical aspects, including the comparative

**论文摘要**: The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe. These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups.

## 7. [Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.06009v1
**作者**: Sunia Tanweer, Firas A. Khasawneh
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:47
**论文摘要**: We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, incl

**作者**: Jie Zhan, Alexander K. Lemmens, Musahid Ahmed, Melanie A. R. Reber
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:39
**论文摘要**: The ultrafast dynamics of azulene have been debated for decades, with reported picosecond decay constants variously attributed to intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), internal conversion, or rotational dephasing. Using polarization and femtosecond time-resolved Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Ionization Spectroscopy with a nanosecond delay window, we disentangle this long-standing inconsistency and show that the early 2-5 ps decay component arises entirely from rotational dephasing o

**论文摘要**: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structur

## 10. [Constraining Hamiltonians from chiral effective field theory with neutron-star data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05999v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.05999v1
**作者**: Cassandra L. Armstrong, Brendan T. Reed, Tate Plohr, Henrik Rose, Soumi De, Rahul Somasundaram, Ingo Tews
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:33
**论文摘要**: Multi-messenger observations of neutron stars (NSs) and their mergers have placed strong constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). The EOS, in turn, depends on microscopic nuclear interactions that are described by nuclear Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians are commonly derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT). Ideally, multi-messenger observations of NSs could be used to directly inform our understanding of EFT interactions, but such a direct inference necessitates millio

**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:58
**论文摘要**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across

**论文摘要**: Though the performance of room-temperature masers has improved over the last decade, relatively little attention has been paid to the optics used to pump the maser's gain medium. In this work, we investigate a novel multi-blade optical ``injector'' that permits more effective and more scaleable pumping. The reported work encompasses an interdisciplinary mix of conceptualization, simulation, crystal growth, fabrication, and microwave engineering. Our gain medium is pentacene dissolved as a solid

**作者**: Bang Zeng, Beilong Tang, Wang Xiang, Ming Li
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:41
**论文摘要**: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to recover the speech signal of a desired speaker from a mixed audio recording, given a short enrollment utterance. Most existing TSE approaches are based on discriminative modeling paradigms. Although effective at suppressing interfering speakers, these methods often struggle to produce speech with high perceptual quality and naturalness. To address this limitation, we first propose LauraTSE, a generative TSE model built upon an auto-regressive decoder-only

**论文摘要**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be critical for time-sensitive data collection missions, yet existing research often relies on simulations that fail to capture real-world complexities. Many studies assume ideal wireless conditions or focus only on path planning, neglecting the challenge of making real-time decisions in dynamic environments.

## 5. [Curving Beam Reflections: Model and Experimental Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05998v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.05998v1
**作者**: Caroline Jane Spindel, Edward Knightly
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 18:29
**论文摘要**: Curving beams are a promising new method for bypassing obstacles in future millimeter-wave to sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks but lack a general predictive model for their reflections from arbitrary surfaces. We show that, unfortunately, attempting to "mirror" the incident beam trajectory across the normal of the reflector, as in ray optics, fails in general. Thus, we introduce the first geometric framework capable of modeling the reflections of arbitrary convex sub-THz curving beams from gener

**论文摘要**: University dropout remains a persistent challenge in higher education systems, yet causal evidence on the mechanisms triggering early disengagement is limited. This study estimates the causal effect of first-time academic failure on subsequent university attrition. Exploiting a sharp institutional grading threshold on a 0-10 scale, we implement a regression discontinuity design (RDD) comparing students who narrowly fail to those who narrowly pass their first attempt.

**论文摘要**: Among variational quantum algorithms designed for NISQ devices, ADAPT-VQE stands out for its robustness against barren plateaus, particularly in estimating molecular ground states. On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAPT-VQE framework with counterdiabatic driving within an adiabatic evolution scheme. Specifically, we

## 9. [Navigating the Sociotechnical Imaginaries of Brazilian Tech Workers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05961v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.05961v1
**作者**: Kenzo Soares Seto
**更新时间**: 2026-01-09 17:30
**论文摘要**: This chapter examines the sociotechnical imaginaries of Brazilian tech workers, a group often overlooked in digital labor research despite their role in designing the digital systems that shape everyday life. Grounded in the idea of sociotechnical imaginaries as collectively constructed visions that guide technology development and governance, the chapter argues that looking from the Global South helps challenge data universalism and foregrounds locally situated values, constraints, and futures.
