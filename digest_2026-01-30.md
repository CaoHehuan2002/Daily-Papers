**论文摘要**: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an 
**核心总结**: 问题：传统Agentic RL依赖稀疏奖励，难以区分中间推理质量；方法：提出Agent-RRM，多维度生成结构化反馈；结果：提升代理轨迹训练效果。

## 2. [Cobordism and Concordance of Surfaces in 4-Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22152v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.22152v1
**作者**: Simeon Hellsten
**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:59
**论文摘要**: We show that two properly embedded compact surfaces in an orientable 4-manifold are cobordant if and only if they are $\mathbb{Z}/2$-homologous and either the 4-manifold has boundary or the surfaces have the same normal Euler number. If the 4-manifold is simply-connected and the surfaces are closed, non-orientable, and cobordant, we show that they are in fact concordant. This completes the classification of closed surfaces in simply-connected 4-manifolds up to concordance. Our methods give new c

**论文摘要**: Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e.
**核心总结**: 问题：资源受限的边缘设备中，CPU难以高效执行大量乘加操作；方法：研究聚焦于优化CPU上的MAC操作执行效率；结果：无。

**论文摘要**: We study a model for nonperturbative unitarization of the four-point contact scalar amplitude in four dimensions. It is defined through an infinite sum of planar diagrams, constructed using two-particle unitarity and crossing symmetry. We reformulate the problem in terms of a set of nonlinear integral equations obeyed by the single and double discontinuities of the amplitude. We then solve them using a neural-network ansatz trained by minimizing a physics-informed loss functional. We obtain a on

## 5. [All-order prescription for facet regions in massless wide-angle scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22144v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.22144v1
**作者**: Yao Ma
**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:57
**论文摘要**: We take a step toward answering a long-standing question in the asymptotic expansion of Feynman integrals: how to systematically determine the regions in the Expansion-by-Regions technique for multiscale processes? Focusing on generic massless wide-angle scattering, we provide an all-order momentum-space prescription for facet regions, which generally dominate -- and in most cases exhaust -- the contributions in a given asymptotic expansion. This extends the Euclidean-space picture, where region

**论文摘要**: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called a
**核心总结**: 问题：现有剪枝方法假设存在单一通用子网络，忽略数据异质性；方法：提出RTL框架，发现多个专用子网络；结果：提升不同输入场景下的模型性能。

## 7. [SMOG: Scalable Meta-Learning for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22131v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.22131v1
**作者**: Leonard Papenmeier, Petru Tighineanu
**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:51
**论文摘要**: Multi-objective optimization aims to solve problems with competing objectives, often with only black-box access to a problem and a limited budget of measurements. In many applications, historical data from related optimization tasks is available, creating an opportunity for meta-learning to accelerate the optimization. Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that sim

**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:49
**论文摘要**: Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions an

**论文摘要**: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control.

**论文摘要**: Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation.

**arXiv ID**: 2601.22158v1
**作者**: Yiyang Lu, Susie Lu, Qiao Sun, Hanhong Zhao, Zhicheng Jiang, Xianbang Wang, Tianhong Li, Zhengyang Geng, Kaiming He
**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:59
**论文摘要**: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The networ

UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations.

**作者**: Zhexin Liang, Zhaoxi Chen, Yongwei Chen, Tianyi Wei, Tengfei Wang, Xingang Pan
**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:55
**论文摘要**: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physic

**论文摘要**: As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or

**论文摘要**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certi

**arXiv ID**: 2601.22108v1
**作者**: Shuqi Ke, Giulia Fanti
**更新时间**: 2026-01-29 18:38
**论文摘要**: Can a small amount of verified goal information steer the expensive self-supervised pretraining of foundation models? Standard pretraining optimizes a fixed proxy objective (e.g., next-token prediction), which can misallocate compute away from downstream capabilities of interest. We introduce V-Pretraining: a value-based, modality-agnostic method for controlled continued pretraining in which a lightweight task designer reshapes the pretraining task to maximize the value of each gradient step.

**核心总结**: 问题：如何用少量验证过的目标信息引导大模型的自监督预训练？；方法：引入V-Pretraining，通过轻量级任务设计优化梯度更新的价值；结果：无。
