**论文摘要**: Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyr

**更新时间**: 2026-01-13 18:49
**论文摘要**: This paper is the second in a series devoted to the study of unstable synthetic deformations through the lens of Malcev theories: certain $\infty$-categorical algebraic theories $\mathcal{P}$ with well-behaved $\infty$-categories $\mathrm{Model}_{\mathcal{P}}$ of models. In this paper, we show that Malcev theories and their models admit a well-behaved deformation theory, generalizing the classical deformation theory of rings and modules.   As our main example, we prove that the Postnikov tower o

**论文摘要**: We obtain effective estimates for the growth rate of the $L^2$-energy of harmonic functions on geodesic balls in complete simply connected non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds with pinched sectional curvature. Our study relies upon a double-sided Price inequality for harmonic functions. Finally, we apply this circle of ideas to study the analytical structure of a potential counterexample to the Singer conjecture in degree one.

## 4. [Extinction in Reaction Network Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08801v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.08801v1
**作者**: Pranav Agarwal, Gheorghe Craciun, Abhishek Deshpande, Jiaxin Jin
**更新时间**: 2026-01-13 18:38
**论文摘要**: In this paper, we study extinction in dynamical systems generated by reaction networks. We introduce two notions: weak extinction and strong extinction, and relate them to the structure of the underlying network through Lyapunov functions and LaSalle's invariance principle. In particular, for all deficiency-zero networks that are not weakly reversible, we provide a geometric construction of linear Lyapunov functions. Using these functions, we establish that if these networks have bounded invaria

## 7. [Simple repair policies and decompositions for semi-coherent systems with simultaneous failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08786v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.08786v1
**作者**: Guido Lagos, Jorge Navarro, Hector Olivero
**更新时间**: 2026-01-13 18:19
**论文摘要**: We consider semi-coherent binary systems that are subject to simultaneous failures of its components. These are systems whose components can be either working or failed; the system can also be working or failed depending on the state of the components; and repairing a component cannot cause the system to fail. We consider that one or more components can fail simultaneously, allowing us to model external shocks and disasters. For this, we use the Lévy-frailty Marshall-Olkin (LFMO) multivariate di

**论文摘要**: We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of integral points of bounded log anticanonical height on a singular quartic del Pezzo surface over arbitrary number fields, with respect to the largest admissible boundary divisor. The resulting Clemens complex is more complicated than usual, and leads to particularly interesting effective cone constants, associated with exponentially many polytopes whose volumes appear in the expected formula. Like a jigsaw puzzle, these polytopes fit together to o

**论文摘要**: We present a critical review of Neural Coverage (NLC), a state-of-the-art DNN coverage criterion by Yuan et al. at ICSE 2023. While NLC proposes to satisfy eight design requirements and demonstrates strong empirical performance, we question some of their theoretical and empirical assumptions. We observe that NLC deviates from core principles of coverage criteria, such as monotonicity and test suite order independence, and could more fully account for key properties of the covariance matrix.
