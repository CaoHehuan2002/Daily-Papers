## 1. [Approximate Decoherence, Recoherence and Records in Isolated Quantum Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19703v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.19703v1
**作者**: Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler, Jiaozi Wang, Andreas Winter
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 15:29
**论文摘要**: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for l
**核心总结**: 问题：量子系统中哪些过去事件能留下可检测记录；方法：基于退相干历史框架，分析近似退相干情况下的记录数量；结果：可靠记录数量远小于可能事件数，取决于退相干程度。

## 2. [Equivariant Nijenhuis Lie Algebras: Extensions to Classical Lie-Theoretic Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19689v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.19689v1
**作者**: Shuai Hou, Zohreh Ravanpak, Yunhe Sheng
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 15:05
**论文摘要**: We develop a structural theory of equivariant Nijenhuis Lie algebras (ENL algebras), namely, Lie algebras equipped with Nijenhuis operators satisfying an equivariance condition with respect to the adjoint representation. This rigidity allows classical Lie bialgebra constructions to extend systematically to the operator-equipped setting. Within this framework, we define ENL bialgebras and establish the associated notions of matched pairs, Manin triples, and Drinfel'd doubles. We show that cobound

## 3. [Signatures of Large-Scale Magnetic Field Disturbances and Switchbacks in Interplanetary Type III Radio Bursts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19687v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.19687v1
**作者**: Daniel L. Clarkson, Eduard P. Kontar
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 15:02
**论文摘要**: Type III solar radio bursts are driven by non-thermal electron beams travelling along heliospheric magnetic fields, with the radio emission frequency drift-rate determined by the beam speed and the plasma density profile. Analysing beam kinematics inferred from the drift-rate reveals behaviour inconsistent with the emitter moving radially through smooth, monotonically decreasing density. We examine whether these features are driven by disturbances in the guiding magnetic field direction, such as

**论文摘要**: Let $θ$ be an involution of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $(\mathrm{U}_v,\mathrm{U}^\imath_v)$ be the associated quantum symmetric pair at an odd root of unity $v$. In this paper, generalizing the approach of De Concini-Kac-Procesi for quantum groups, we study the structures and irreducible representations of the iquantum group $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$.   We establish a Frobenius center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ as a coideal subalgebra of the Frobenius center of the quantum gro

**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 14:47
**论文摘要**: Data augmentation is a crucial tool in time series forecasting, especially for deep learning architectures that require a large training sample size to generalize effectively. However, extensive datasets are not always available in real-world scenarios. Although many data augmentation methods exist, their limitations include the use of transformations that do not adequately preserve data properties. This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation

## 6. [A topology on the Fremlin tensor product between locally solid vector lattices with applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19661v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.19661v1
**作者**: Omid Zabeti
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 14:40
**论文摘要**: Let $E$ and $F$ be locally solid vector lattices. We introduce a locally solid topology on the Fremlin tensor product $E\overline{\otimes}F$ and we denote it by $τ_{E\overline{\otimes}F}$. It extends the Fremlin projective tensor product in the setting of Banach lattices. The main purpose of the paper is to determine conditions under which, the canonical bilinear mapping \[E\times F\to (E\overline{\otimes}F,τ_{E\overline{\otimes}F}),\hspace{0.50cm} (x,y)\mapsto x\otimes y,\] is uniformly continu

## 7. [One Token Is Enough: Improving Diffusion Language Models with a Sink Token](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19657v1)

**作者**: Zihou Zhang, Zheyong Xie, Li Zhong, Haifeng Liu, Shaosheng Cao
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 14:32
**论文摘要**: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, the

## 1. [Lensing without mixing: Probing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and other scale-dependent features in cosmic shear surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19696v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.19696v1
**作者**: David Touzeau, Alexandre Barthélémy, Francis Bernardeau
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 15:21
**论文摘要**: Weak-gravitational lensing tends to wash out scale and time-dependent features of the clustering of matter, such as the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) which appear in the form of wiggles in the matter power spectrum but that disappear in the analogous lensing $C_\ell$. This is a direct consequence of lensing being a projected effect. In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity -- often deemed "erasing the signal" -- induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau

**论文摘要**: Decidability or complexity issues about the consistency problem for description logics with concrete domains have already been analysed with tableaux-based or type elimination methods. Concrete domains in ontologies are essential to consider concrete objects and predefined relations. In this work, we expose an automata-based approach leading to the optimal upper bound EXPTIME, that is designed by enriching the transitions with symbolic constraints. We show that the nonemptiness problem for such

**作者**: Shusen Liu, Pascal Jahan Elahi, Ugo Varetto
**更新时间**: 2026-01-27 14:11
**论文摘要**: Quantum cloud platforms remain fundamentally non-virtualised: despite rapid hardware scaling, each user program still monopolises an entire quantum processor, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which domin
