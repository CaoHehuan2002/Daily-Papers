## 1. [Quadratic Programming over Linearly Ordered Fields: Decidability and Attainment of Optimal Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17969v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.17969v1
**作者**: Dmytro O. Plutenko
**更新时间**: 2026-01-25 19:53
**论文摘要**: Classical existence theorems and solution methods for quadratic programming traditionally rely on the analytical properties of real numbers, specifically compactness and completeness. These tools are unavailable in general linearly ordered fields, such as the field of rational numbers or non-Archimedean structures, rendering standard analytical proofs insufficient in these general algebraic settings. In this paper, we establish a unified algebraic framework for the decidability of indefinite qua

**论文摘要**: This paper investigates density driven flow in porous media, focusing on the roles of viscosity contrast, density contrast, and linear adsorption. In this setup, the fluid on top is heavier and more viscous than the fluid below. Under the effect of gravity, this system becomes unstable, and finger-like structures appear. The phenomenon is described mathematically by coupling Darcy's law with a convection-diffusion reaction equation. The nonlinearity in this model arises mainly from the concentra

## 3. [Pass-through with Price Dispersion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17964v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.17964v1
**作者**: Brian C. Albrecht, Mark Whitmeyer
**更新时间**: 2026-01-25 19:44
**论文摘要**: How do cost shocks pass through to prices in markets with price dispersion? Pass-through analysis typically assumes a single equilibrium price, but empirical studies consistently document substantial price variation, even for homogeneous products. This paper develops a tractable framework that decomposes the pass-through problem into two distinct tiers. The first is a competition layer where consumers' \textit{consideration sets} determine equilibrium distributions of normalized margins. The sec

**论文摘要**: The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both

**更新时间**: 2026-01-25 19:06
**论文摘要**: We investigate the neural Actor Critic algorithm using shallow neural networks for both the Actor and Critic models. The focus of this work is twofold: first, to compare the convergence properties of the network outputs under various scaling schemes as the network width and the number of training steps tend to infinity; and second, to provide precise control of the approximation error associated with each scaling regime. Previous work has shown convergence to ordinary differential equations with

In this work, we investigate the tensor form factors of the baryon hyperons $Ω^-$, $Σ^{*+}$, and $Ξ^{*-}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. For the $Σ^{*+}$ and $Ξ^{*-}$ baryons, both isosinglet and isovector tensor currents are considered, allowing us to disentangle flavor-dependent tensor contributions. The complete set of tensor form factors is numerically evaluated in the m

## 8. [Dissipative Learning: A Framework for Viable Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17933v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.17933v1
**作者**: Laurent Caraffa
**更新时间**: 2026-01-25 18:10
**论文摘要**: We propose a perspective in which learning is an intrinsically dissipative process. Forgetting and regularization are not heuristic add-ons but structural requirements for adaptive systems. Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.   A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, sho

**更新时间**: 2026-01-25 17:58
**论文摘要**: Controllable image generation is fundamental to the success of modern generative AI, yet it faces a critical trade-off between semantic fidelity and inference speed. The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This

## 3. [Cloaking laminate design based on GPT-vanishing structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17932v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.17932v1
**作者**: Eleanor Gemida, Mikyoung Lim
**更新时间**: 2026-01-25 18:08
**论文摘要**: We propose a near-cloaking design which is a lamination of a finite number of layers of isotropic materials. The proposed design is an approximation of a cloaking material obtained by pushing forward a multi-coated structure for which the coating cancels the generalized polarization tensors (GPTs) up to several leading orders. The enhanced cloaking effect achieved by the GPT-vanishing structure permits a coarser microscale requirement and reduces the contrast in the constituent isotropic materia
