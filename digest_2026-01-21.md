**论文摘要**: People's identities change during life transitions, e.g., studying abroad. They bring everyday objects that embody memories and reflect their identities during such moves. To assist in these transitions, we ask how people's human identities could be influenced by their objects through an artificial agent. This paper presents an exploratory research-through-design study around how people undergoing life transitions experience conversing with their everyday objects through a chatbot. Drawing on a

**论文摘要**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to interpret visualizations, yet little is known about why they fail. We present the first systematic analysis of barriers to visualization literacy in MLLMs. Using the regenerated Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (reVLAT) benchmark with synthetic data, we open-coded 309 erroneous responses from four state-of-the-art models with a barrier-centric strategy adapted from human visualization literacy research. Our analysis yields a

**作者**: Bruno Ferman, Davi Siqueira, Vitor Possebom
**更新时间**: 2026-01-18 20:04
**论文摘要**: This paper develops a unified framework for partial identification and inference in stratified experiments with attrition, accommodating both equal and heterogeneous treatment shares across strata. For equal-share designs, we apply recent theory for finely stratified experiments to Lee bounds, yielding closed-form, design-consistent variance estimators and properly sized confidence intervals. Simulations show that the conventional formula can overstate uncertainty, while our approach delivers ti

**论文摘要**: Virtual reality (VR) platforms and apps collect user sensor data, including motion, facial, eye, and hand data, in abstracted form. These data may expose users to unique privacy risks without their knowledge or meaningful awareness, yet the extent of these risks remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose VR ProfiLens, a framework to study user profiling based on VR sensor data and the resulting privacy risks across consumer VR apps. To systematically study this problem, we first devel

**更新时间**: 2026-01-18 19:51
**论文摘要**: Photonic crystals allow unprecedented control over how light is confined, propagates, and interacts with matter. Their development has had a transformative impact on optics and physics, and they remain the central platform for both fundamental discoveries and practical photonic technologies. However, the relatively large footprint and substrate-bound nature of photonic crystal structures have so far strongly limited their use as miniature optical devices or biointegrated sensors. Here, we overco

**arXiv ID**: 2601.12559v1
**作者**: Yvan Labiche
**更新时间**: 2026-01-18 19:48
**论文摘要**: Category-Partition is a functional testing technique that is based on the idea that the input domain of the system under test can be divided into sub-domains, with the assumption that inputs that belong to the same sub-domain trigger a similar behaviour and that therefore it is sufficient to select one input from each sub-domain. Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form tes
**核心总结**: 问题：如何有效进行功能测试；方法：使用Category-Partition方法划分输入域为子域并选择代表输入；结果：提高测试效率和覆盖率。

**论文摘要**: Indium selenide (In$_2$Se$_3$) has garnered significant attention for its intriguing properties and applications in batteries, solar cells, photodetectors and ferroelectric devices. However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric α-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is

**论文摘要**: Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large

**作者**: Sofiya Zaichyk
**更新时间**: 2026-01-18 20:47
**论文摘要**: We present Semantic Fusion (SF), a formal framework for decentralized semantic coordination in multi-agent systems. SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the gl

**论文摘要**: Estimating the position and orientation of a camera with respect to an observed scene is one of the central problems in computer vision, particularly in the context of camera calibration and multi-sensor systems. This paper addresses the planar Perspective--$n$--Point problem, with special emphasis on the initial estimation of the pose of a calibration object. As a solution, we propose the \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm, which combines the classical quadratic formulation of the reconstruction e

## 5. [Analytic Modeling of Tidally Locked Rocky Planet Atmospheres Across Dynamical Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12556v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.12556v1
**作者**: Christopher P. Wirth, Diana Powell, Robin Wordsworth
**更新时间**: 2026-01-18 19:39
**论文摘要**: We present a new first-principles analytic approach to interpreting eclipses and phase curves of rocky planets. Observations with JWST have reported nondetections of atmospheres around the majority of hot rocky planets orbiting M dwarfs. However, most of these "bare rock" inferences are based on models that are ill-suited to many currently observable planets, as they were developed for use on cooler, slower-rotating bodies. In particular, these models rely on the weak temperature gradient assump
