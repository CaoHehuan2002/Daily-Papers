## 1. [PLATE: Plasticity-Tunable Efficient Adapters for Geometry-Aware Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03846v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.03846v1
**作者**: Romain Cosentino
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:59
**论文摘要**: We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the cons
**核心总结**: 问题：预训练模型持续学习中无法访问旧任务数据；方法：利用预训练网络的几何冗余，通过冗余神经元代理主导特征方向；结果：提出无需旧数据的持续学习方法。

**论文摘要**: Recent theoretical work has revealed that basic observables of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, known as in-in or cosmological correlators, exhibit surprisingly simple mathematical structure reminiscent of scattering amplitudes in flat space. For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices.

**作者**: Erfan Miahi, Eugene Belilovsky
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:56
**论文摘要**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component for post-training large language models (LLMs). However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We p

**作者**: Silouanos Brazitikos, Apostolos Giannopoulos, Antonios Hmadi, Natalia Tziotziou
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:47
**论文摘要**: We study the maximal perimeter constant of isotropic log-concave probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. For a measure $μ$, this quantity, denoted by $Γ(μ)$, is defined as the supremum of the $μ$-perimeter over all convex bodies and measures the largest possible boundary contribution of convex sets with respect to $μ$. Let $$Γ_n := \sup\{Γ(μ) : μ\text{ is an isotropic log-concave probability measure on } \mathbb{R}^n\}.$$ We prove that $Γ_n \leqslant Cn^{3/2}$, where $C>0$ is an absolute constan

**作者**: Ethan Pronovost, Khimya Khetarpal, Siddhartha Srinivasa
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:33
**论文摘要**: Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but

## 8. [They Said Memes Were Harmless-We Found the Ones That Hurt: Decoding Jokes, Symbols, and Cultural References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03822v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.03822v1
**作者**: Sahil Tripathi, Gautam Siddharth Kashyap, Mehwish Nasim, Jian Yang, Jiechao Gao, Usman Naseem
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:29
**论文摘要**: Meme-based social abuse detection is challenging because harmful intent often relies on implicit cultural symbolism and subtle cross-modal incongruence. Prior approaches, from fusion-based methods to in-context learning with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), have made progress but remain limited by three factors: i) cultural blindness (missing symbolic context), ii) boundary ambiguity (satire vs. abuse confusion), and iii) lack of interpretability (opaque model reasoning). We introduce CROSS
**核心总结**: 问题：Meme社交滥用检测面临文化符号隐含意图和跨模态不一致的挑战；方法：提出CROSS模型，解决文化盲视、边界模糊和可解释性不足的问题；结果：提升检测准确性与模型解释性。

**论文摘要**: Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic sca

## 4. [Perfect Network Resilience in Polynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03827v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.03827v1
**作者**: Matthias Bentert, Stefan Schmid
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:34
**论文摘要**: Modern communication networks support local fast rerouting mechanisms to quickly react to link failures: nodes store a set of conditional rerouting rules which define how to forward an incoming packet in case of incident link failures. The rerouting decisions at any node $v$ must rely solely on local information available at $v$: the link from which a packet arrived at $v$, the target of the packet, and the incident link failures at $v$. Ideally, such rerouting mechanisms provide perfect resilie
**核心总结**: 问题：通信网络在链路故障时需依赖节点本地信息进行快速路由恢复；方法：节点根据到达链路、目标地址和故障情况执行条件性重路由；结果：理想情况下可实现完全弹性，但实际中受限于局部信息。

## 5. [Preference-based Conditional Treatment Effects and Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03823v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.03823v1
**作者**: Dovid Parnas, Mathieu Even, Julie Josse, Uri Shalit
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:31
**论文摘要**: We introduce a new preference-based framework for conditional treatment effect estimation and policy learning, built on the Conditional Preference-based Treatment Effect (CPTE). CPTE requires only that outcomes be ranked under a preference rule, unlocking flexible modeling of heterogeneous effects with multivariate, ordinal, or preference-driven outcomes. This unifies applications such as conditional probability of necessity and sufficiency, conditional Win Ratio, and Generalized Pairwise Compar
**核心总结**: 问题：条件治疗效应估计与策略学习中的偏好建模需求；方法：基于条件偏好治疗效应（CPTE）的框架，通过排序结果进行灵活建模；结果：可统一处理多变量、有序或偏好驱动的结果。

## 6. [Global Testing in Multivariate Regression Discontinuity Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03819v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.03819v1
**作者**: Artem Samiahulin
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:22
**论文摘要**: Regression discontinuity (RD) designs with multiple running variables arise in a growing number of empirical applications, including geographic boundaries and multi-score assignment rules. Although recent methodological work has extended estimation and inference tools to multivariate settings, far less attention has been devoted to developing global testing methods that formally assess whether a discontinuity exists anywhere along a multivariate treatment boundary. Existing approaches perform we

**作者**: Xinhang Ma, Junlin Wu, Yiannis Kantaros, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 18:01
**论文摘要**: Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain v

## 8. [Understanding Agent Scaling in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems via Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03794v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.03794v1
**作者**: Yingxuan Yang, Chengrui Qu, Muning Wen, Laixi Shi, Ying Wen, Weinan Zhang, Adam Wierman, Shangding Gu
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 17:58
**论文摘要**: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does dive

**作者**: Jianhao Ruan, Zhihao Xu, Yiran Peng, Fashen Ren, Zhaoyang Yu, Xinbing Liang, Jinyu Xiang, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu, Yuyu Luo, Jiayi Zhang
**更新时间**: 2026-02-03 17:46
**论文摘要**: Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositi
**核心总结**: 问题：现有语言代理在处理复杂长周期任务时适应性不足；方法：提出统一的代理抽象框架，将代理建模为指令、上下文、工具和模型的元组；结果：提升多轮任务解决的动态适应能力。

**论文摘要**: The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language
**核心总结**: 问题：VLA模型在资源受限机器人平台部署面临计算需求高难题；方法：分析低比特量化对VLA模型的适用性，指出均匀量化方法不适用；结果：需系统性研究适合VLA的量化策略。
