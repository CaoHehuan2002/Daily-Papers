## 1. [Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.09705v1
**作者**: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Andrew L. Goodwin, Clare P. Grey, Siân E. Dutton
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:58
**论文摘要**: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different ma
**核心总结**: 问题：Jahn-Teller畸变在关联氧化物材料中影响物理性质，低温下出现长程轨道有序，高温下有序消失；方法：研究不同材料中Jahn-Teller畸变的相变特性；结果：相变性质因材料而异。

## 2. [LLMs can Compress LLMs: Adaptive Pruning by Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09694v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.09694v1
**作者**: Sai Varun Kodathala, Rakesh Vunnam
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:45
**论文摘要**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation

## 3. [Electronic structure and elasticity of the Ta-W solid solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09690v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.09690v1
**作者**: Kareem Abdelmaqsoud, John R. Kitchin, Michael Widom
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:43
**论文摘要**: The brittleness or ductility of metals has long been attributed to their elastic constants, with high Poisson ratio, or equivalently high Pugh ratio, favoring greater ductility. Growing evidence links ductility with their electronic structure. Consequently, it is desirable to understand how the electronic structure affects the elastic constants. Here, we examine the Ta-W binary alloy system, which evolves from ductile character at Ta-rich compositions to brittleness at high W. We show that a cha

## 4. [Disentangling Task Conflicts in Multi-Task LoRA via Orthogonal Gradient Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09684v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.09684v1
**作者**: Ziyu Yang, Guibin Chen, Yuxin Yang, Aoxiong Zeng, Xiangquan Yang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:36
**论文摘要**: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due
**核心总结**: 问题：多任务学习与LoRA结合时存在负迁移问题；方法：共享单一适配器导致任务间梯度冲突；结果：任务性能低于单任务微调。

## 5. [Automating Supply Chain Disruption Monitoring via an Agentic AI Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09680v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.09680v1
**作者**: Sara AlMahri, Liming Xu, Alexandra Brintrup
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:28
**论文摘要**: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework

**论文摘要**: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inf

**arXiv ID**: 2601.09662v1
**作者**: Ahmadreza Khazaeipoul, Eckhard Meinrenken
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 17:53
**论文摘要**: For oriented surfaces $Σ$ with boundary, we consider the infinite-dimensional deformation space of projective structures on $Σ$ with nondegenerate boundary, up to isotopies fixing the boundary. We show that this space carries a natural symplectic structure, and is a Hamiltonian space for the symplectic groupoid integrating the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii-space of the boundary.

## 8. [Exploring Fine-Tuning for Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09654v1)

**作者**: Aditya Tanna, Pratinav Seth, Mohamed Bouadi, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 17:40
**论文摘要**: Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This w

**作者**: Lisa Schneckenreiter, Sohvi Luukkonen, Lukas Friedrich, Daniel Kuhn, Günter Klambauer
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:45
**论文摘要**: Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding

**作者**: Lei Huang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:15
**论文摘要**: Designing large coupling memory quasi-cyclic spatially-coupled LDPC (QC-SC-LDPC) codes with low error floors requires eliminating specific harmful substructures (e.g., short cycles) induced by edge spreading and lifting. Building on our work~\cite{r15} that introduced a Clique Lovász Local Lemma (CLLL)-based design principle and a Moser--Tardos (MT)-type constructive approach, this work quantifies the size and structure of the feasible design space. Using the quantitative CLLL, we derive explici

**arXiv ID**: 2601.09673v1
**作者**: László Csató, András Gyimesi
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 18:15
**论文摘要**: Existing match classification models in the tournament design literature have two major limitations: a contestant is considered indifferent only if uncertain future results do never affect its prize, and competitive matches are not distinguished with respect to the incentives of the contestants. We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities und

**arXiv ID**: 2601.09640v1
**作者**: David Miller, Rémi A. Chou
**更新时间**: 2026-01-14 17:23
**论文摘要**: We generalize secret-sharing models that rely on correlated randomness and public communication, originally designed for a fixed access structure, to support a sequence of dynamic access structures, which we term an Additive Access Structure. Specifically, the access structure is allowed to monotonically grow by having any subset of participants added to it at a given time step, and the dealer only learns of these changes to the access structure on the time step that they occur. For this model,

**论文摘要**: While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistanc

**论文摘要**: Teleportation is one of the most common locomotion techniques in virtual reality, yet its perceptual properties remain underexplored. While redirected walking research has shown that users' movements can be subtly manipulated without detection, similar imperceptible adjustments for teleportation have not been systematically investigated. This study examines the thresholds at which teleportation displacements become noticeable to users. We conducted a repeated-measures experiment in which partici
