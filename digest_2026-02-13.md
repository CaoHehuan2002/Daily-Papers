## 1. [Stroke of Surprise: Progressive Semantic Illusions in Vector Sketching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12280v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12280v1
**作者**: Huai-Hsun Cheng, Siang-Ling Zhang, Yu-Lun Liu
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:59
**论文摘要**: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint":
**核心总结**: 问题：传统视觉错觉依赖空间操作，但缺乏语义层面的动态变化；方法：提出Progressive Semantic Illusions任务，通过逐步添加笔画实现语义转变；结果：设计Stroke of Surprise框架，优化矢量笔画以满足不同阶段的语义解释。

## 2. [Creative Ownership in the Age of AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12270v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12270v1
**作者**: Annie Liang, Jay Lu
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:56
**论文摘要**: Copyright law focuses on whether a new work is "substantially similar" to an existing one, but generative AI can closely imitate style without copying content, a capability now central to ongoing litigation. We argue that existing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work if it could not have been generated without that work in its training corpus. To operationalize this definition, we model genera

**arXiv ID**: 2602.12268v1
**作者**: Zhen Zhang, Kaiqiang Song, Xun Wang, Yebowen Hu, Weixiang Yan, Chenyang Zhao, Henry Peng Zou, Haoyun Deng, Sathish Reddy Indurthi, Shujian Liu, Simin Ma, Xiaoyang Wang, Xin Eric Wang, Song Wang
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:55
**论文摘要**: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2,

## 4. [Transmit or Idle: Efficient AoI Optimal Transmission Policy for Gossiping Receivers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12264v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12264v1
**作者**: Irtiza Hasan, Ahmed Arafa
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:53
**论文摘要**: We study the optimal transmission and scheduling policy for a transmitter (source) communicating with two gossiping receivers aiming at tracking the source's status over time using the age of information (AoI) metric. Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's

## 5. [Think like a Scientist: Physics-guided LLM Agent for Equation Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12259v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12259v1
**作者**: Jianke Yang, Ohm Venkatachalam, Mohammad Kianezhad, Sharvaree Vadgama, Rose Yu
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:49
**论文摘要**: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries
**核心总结**: 问题：科学现象的符号公式解释依赖于多步推理，但现有LLM方法直接从数据中猜测方程；方法：提出一种基于多步推理的方程发现框架，模拟科学家推导物理性质的过程；结果：提升方程发现的准确性和可解释性。

## 6. [Vision Transformer for Multi-Domain Phase Retrieval in Coherent Diffraction Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12255v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12255v1
**作者**: Jialun Liu, David Yang, Ian Robinson
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:42
**论文摘要**: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions f
**核心总结**: 问题：强相位区域中BCDI相位重构困难，尤其在相位域问题中；方法：传统迭代求解器难以处理强相位引起的分裂布拉格峰和密集条纹；结果：求解过程易停滞或返回不同解。

**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:31
**论文摘要**: Unstructured documents like PDFs contain valuable structured information, but downstream systems require this data in reliable, standardized formats. LLMs are increasingly deployed to automate this extraction, making accuracy and reliability paramount. However, progress is bottlenecked by two gaps. First, no end-to-end benchmark evaluates PDF-to-JSON extraction under enterprise-scale schema breadth. Second, no principled methodology captures the semantics of nested extraction, where fields deman
**核心总结**: 问题：PDF文档中结构化信息提取面临准确性和可靠性挑战；方法：缺乏端到端基准和语义捕获的系统性方法；结果：无。

## 8. [Intrinsic-Energy Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures Induce Quasimetric Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12245v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12245v1
**作者**: Anthony Kobanda, Waris Radji
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:30
**论文摘要**: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) aim to learn representations by predicting target embeddings from context embeddings, inducing a scalar compatibility energy in a latent space. In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functi
**核心总结**: 问题：如何将联合嵌入预测架构（JEPAs）与准度量强化学习（QRL）结合；方法：通过限制到JEPA能量函数的合理类别，建立两者联系；结果：揭示了在潜在空间中通过兼容性能量实现目标导向控制的可能。

## 9. [Extending the Cosmological Collider: New Scaling Regimes and Constraints from BOSS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12232v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12232v1
**作者**: Daniel Green, Jiashu Han, Benjamin Wallisch
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:10
**论文摘要**: Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields during inflation offers a compelling observational target. Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios.

However, existing retrieval models are not designed for long document retrieval and fail to address several key challenges of long document retrieval, including context-awareness, causal dependence, and scope of retrieval. In this paper, we proposed AttentionRetriever, a novel long document retrieval model that leverages attention mechanism and entity-based

**arXiv ID**: 2602.12273v1
**作者**: Yongcun Song, Xiaoming Yuan, Hangrui Yue, Tianyou Zeng
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:57
**论文摘要**: We propose an optimization-informed deep neural network approach, named iUzawa-Net, aiming for the first solver that enables real-time solutions for a class of nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed learnable neural networks. We prove universal approximation properties and establish the asymptotic $\v
**核心总结**: 问题：实时求解非光滑线性PDE最优控制问题；方法：提出iUzawa-Net，基于不精确Uzawa方法，用神经网络替代传统预条件器和求解器；结果：证明了通用逼近性及渐近收敛性。

**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:56
**论文摘要**: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not relia
**核心总结**: 问题：实时视频生成中，3D自注意力的二次复杂度导致效率瓶颈；方法：研究发现现有稀疏注意力近似在少步、自回归的实时场景中失效；结果：视频注意力不可靠，需重新设计高效注意力机制。

## 4. [Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12267v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12267v1
**作者**: Duy Nguyen, Jiachen Yao, Jiayun Wang, Julius Berner, Animashree Anandkumar
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:54
**论文摘要**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining op
**核心总结**: 问题：传统自监督学习方法依赖固定掩码比例，限制了灵活性；方法：提出FGNO框架，将扰动水平作为可学习参数；结果：提升时间序列表示学习性能。

## 5. [Legitimate Overrides in Decentralized Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12260v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2602.12260v1
**作者**: Oghenekaro Elem, Nimrod Talmon
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:51
**论文摘要**: Decentralized protocols claim immutable, rule-based execution, yet many embed emergency mechanisms such as chain-level freezes, protocol pauses, and account quarantines. These overrides are crucial for responding to exploits and systemic failures, but they expose a core tension: when does intervention preserve trust and when is it perceived as illegitimate discretion? With approximately $10$ billion in technical exploit losses potentially addressable by onchain intervention (2016--2026), the des

**arXiv ID**: 2602.12241v1
**作者**: Manjunath Kudlur, Evan King, James Wang, Pete Warden
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:20
**论文摘要**: Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this gl
**核心总结**: 问题：资源受限的边缘设备在低延迟语音应用中面临TTFT和准确率的挑战；方法：使用全注意力Transformer编码器提升ASR准确率；结果：全注意力机制虽准确但计算开销大，需优化以适应边缘设备。

**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:16
**论文摘要**: Data mixing -- determining the ratios of data from different domains -- is a first-order concern for training language models (LMs). While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like

**作者**: Sofia Mäkinen, Andrew B. Duncan, Tapio Helin
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:11
**论文摘要**: Experimental design is central to science and engineering. A ubiquitous challenge is how to maximize the value of information obtained from expensive or constrained experimental settings. Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) provides a principled framework for addressing such questions. In this paper, we study experimental design problems such as the optimization of sensor locations over a continuous domain in the context of linear Bayesian inverse problems.

**arXiv ID**: 2602.12231v1
**作者**: Robert Bredereck, Bin Sun, Eyal Briman, Nimrod Talmon
**更新时间**: 2026-02-12 18:10
**论文摘要**: The Adjusted Winner (AW) method is a fundamental procedure for the fair division of indivisible resources between two agents. However, its reliance on splitting resources can lead to practical complications. To address this limitation, we propose an extension of AW that allows the sale of selected resources under a budget constraint, with the proceeds subsequently redistributed, thereby aiming for allocations that remain as equitable as possible. Alongside developing this extended framework, we 
**核心总结**: 问题：传统AW方法因需分割资源而存在实际操作难题；方法：提出扩展的AW方法，允许在预算约束下出售部分资源并重新分配收益；结果：旨在实现更公平的资源分配。
