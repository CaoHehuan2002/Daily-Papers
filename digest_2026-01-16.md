## 1. [Safe Trajectory Gradient Flow Control of a Grid-Interfacing Inverter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10671v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10671v1
**作者**: Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:36
**论文摘要**: Grid-interfacing inverters serve as the interface between renewable energy resources and the electric power grid, offering fast, programmable control capabilities. However, their operation is constrained by hardware limitations, such as bounds on the current magnitude. Existing control methods for these systems often neglect these constraints during controller design and instead rely on ad hoc limiters, which can introduce instability or degrade performance. In this work, we present a control fr

**论文摘要**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collab
**核心总结**: 问题：LLM进化搜索中存在上下文污染、模式崩溃和协作薄弱等失败模式；方法：提出系统化框架以管理进化过程；结果：提升搜索效率与探索能力。

**arXiv ID**: 2601.10644v1
**作者**: Eugene Yang, Andrew Yates, Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield, Trevor Adriaanse
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 18:04
**论文摘要**: Retrieval models are key components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which generate search queries, process the documents returned, and generate a response. RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplificatio

**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 17:52
**论文摘要**: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within
**核心总结**: 问题：3D人类动作与2D视频生成存在内在耦合关系；方法：提出CoMoVi框架，同步耦合两个视频扩散模型生成3D动作和视频；结果：无。

**论文摘要**: Despite rapid progress in text-to-speech (TTS), open-source systems still lack truly instruction-following, fine-grained control over core speech attributes (e.g., pitch, speaking rate, age, emotion, and style). We present VoiceSculptor, an open-source unified system that bridges this gap by integrating instruction-based voice design and high-fidelity voice cloning in a single framework. It generates controllable speaker timbre directly from natural-language descriptions, supports iterative refi

**论文摘要**: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($α_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($α_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existen

**论文摘要**: Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling. However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and introduce iTIMO, a dataset specifically tailored for this purpose. We identify the lack of {\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this t

**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 17:23
**论文摘要**: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and i

**论文摘要**: This work establishes the fundamental limits of the classical problem of multi-user distributed computing of linearly separable functions. In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions,

**论文摘要**: We determine the complete structure of the symmetry algebras associated with the N-body Calogero-Moser system and its maximally superintegrable discretization. We prove that the discretization naturally leads to a nontrivial deformation of the continuous symmetry algebra, with the discretization parameter playing the rôle of a deformation parameter. This phenomenon illustrates how discrete superintegrable systems can be viewed as natural sources of deformed polynomial algebraic structures. As a

**论文摘要**: Snowflakes play a crucial role in weather and climate. A significant portion of precipitation that reaches the surface originates as ice, even when it ultimately falls as rain. Contrary to the popular image of symmetric, dendritic crystals, most large snowflakes are irregular aggregates formed through the collision of primary ice crystals, such as hexagonal plates, columns, and dendrites. These aggregates exhibit complex, fractal-like structures, particularly at large sizes. Despite this structu

## 7. [Unifying soft and hard dynamics: The hard current algebra in celestial holography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10601v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.10601v1
**作者**: Reiko Liu, Wen-Jie Ma
**更新时间**: 2026-01-15 17:15
**论文摘要**: Soft current algebras capture the infrared structure of scattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes, but an analogous algebraic description of finite-energy dynamics has been missing. We uncover an infinite-dimensional hard current algebra that encodes finite-energy contributions to scattering and implies novel Ward identities. The soft current algebras are not independent but arise naturally from the hard ones. This provides a unified algebraic framework underlying quantum theory in flat space

**论文摘要**: As LLM-based systems increasingly operate as agents embedded within human social and technical systems, alignment can no longer be treated as a property of an isolated model, but must be understood in relation to the environments in which these agents act. Even the most sophisticated methods of alignment, such as Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RHLF) or through AI Feedback (RLAIF) cannot ensure control once internal goal structures diverge from developer intent. We identify three
